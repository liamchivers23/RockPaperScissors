# RockPaperScissors

Why Rock Paper scissors?

-I wanted to make a game, that was fairly simple, but also required dom manipulation and mainly working in JavaScript. Most of my previous projects were HTML and css mainly, with a little sprinkle of dom manipulation sprinkled in. It was also a project for The Odin Project.



What did i learn?

-Mainly i learnt that you didnt have to add event listeners onto every button if they were grouped, a loop with an event listener worked just fine, and from this i can go back to my older projects that i used event listeners everywhere and re-work them


Do i want to add anything else in the future when i learn more JavaScript?

-Absolutely. I want it to look cleaner, with more options instead of rock, paper and scissors. I also want to do some animations and color schemes, that make it look a tad bit friendlier to the eyes üï∂Ô∏è

Did i enjoy making it?

-Absolutely :)
